# Markov Decision Processes

We started looking at different agent behavior architectures starting from the [planning agents]({{<ref "../planning">}}) where the _model_ of the environment is known and with _no interaction_ with it the agent improves its policy, using this model as well as problem solving and logical reasoning skills. 

We now look at agents that can plan _by interacting_ with the environment still knowing the model.
