# Logical Agents & Propositional Logic

We have seen in [route planning]({{<ref "../route">}}) that for some problems agents do not need to possess significant representational abilities - its enough to represent the environment states as _atomic_.  

We also have seen in the an earlier chapter where we introduced a _dynamical system_ governing the state evolution of the environment that a state is composed of variables and such factored representations are key in accepting solutions at the _belief_ s. that  is non-deterministic and possesses either because the action are noisy [route planning]({{<ref "../route">}})
