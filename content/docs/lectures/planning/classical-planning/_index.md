# Classical Planning

## Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)

In [propositional logic-based planning]({{<ref "../propositional-logic">}}) we have seen the combinatorial explosion problem that results from the need to include in the reasoning / inference step all possible states and actions combinations over time. To avoid such explosion, with obvious benefits to the planning efficiency, we introduce a language called Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) that allows for compressive expressiveness at the action space via _action schemas_ as we will see shortly. PDDL is positioned at the input of the _domain independent_ planner as shown in the figure below.

*Planning System: A domain-independent solver or planner takes two inputs: 1) the domain
model written in a planning language and 2) a problem definition that describes the initial state $i$ and the desired
goal state $g$ using the domain modelâ€™s terminology; and produces as output a plan, that is, a sequence of actions
that takes the agent from the initial state to the goal state. From [here](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A1727bc3f-c0ca-4439-9590-914339678723)*

PDDL expresses the four things we need to plan a sequence of actions. The set of all predicates and action schemas are defined in the **domain** file ($\mathtt{domain.pddl}$) as shown next. 

| Domain Syntax | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**Types** | A description of the possible _types_ of objects in the world. A type can inherit from another type. | 
|**Constants** | The set of _constants_, which are objects which appear in all problem instances of this domain.  The second part of the domain description is a set of _predicates_. Each predicate is described by a name and a signature, consisting of an ordered list of types. |
|**Predicates** | Properties of the objects (contained in the problem specification) we are interested in. Each property evaluates to TRUE or FALSE. The domain also describes a set of derived predicates, which are predicates associated with a logical expression. The value of each derived predicate is computed automatically by evaluating the logical expression associated with it. |
|**Actions / Operators** | Actions are described by action schemas that effectively define the functions needed to do problem-solving search. The schema consist of the _name_, the signature or the list of all the boolean _variables_ that are _ground_ and functionless, a _precondition_ and _effect_. The signature is now an ordered list of named parameters, each with a type. |
| | The **precondition** is a logical formula, whose basic building blocks are the above mentioned predicates, combined using the standard first order logic logical connectives. The predicates can only be parametrized by the operator parameters, the domain constraints, or, if they appear within the scope of a forall or exists statement, by the variable introduced by the quantifier. | 
| | The **effect** is similar, except that it described a partial assignment, rather than a formula, and thus can not contain any disjunctions. | 

For the famous Blocks world shown below where a robotic arm must reason to stack blocks according what the goal is, we list the corresponding domain PDDL specification.

The objects, the initial state and the goal specifications are defined in the **problem** file ($\mathtt{problem.pddl}$) as shown next.

| Problem Syntax | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**Initial State** | Each state is represented as conjunction of ground boolean variables. For example,  $$\mathtt{On(Box_1, Table_2) \land On(Box_2, Table_2)}$$  is a state expression. $\mathtt{Box_1}$ is distinct than $\mathtt{Box_2}$. All fluents that are not specified are assumed to be FALSE.|
|**Goal** | All things we want to be TRUE. The goal is like a precondition - a conjunction of literals that may contain variables.|

You need to experiment with [this planning tool](http://editor.planning.domains/) to make sure you understand _what_ PDDL does and be familiar with the workflow of generating a plan. Click on Import and look under the International Planning Competition (IPC) 2000 for the blocks word problem.
