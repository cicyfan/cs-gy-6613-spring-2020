##  Workflow Steps
Although the ML project checklist provided in Appendix B of Garon's book is extensive (we will go through this list in the lecture as we go through your first ML application) for now focus on the eight steps as shown below.

> As discussed the data pipeline is responsible for providing the training datasets if the aim is to train (or retrain) a model. For the purposes of this lecture we assume that we deal with *small data* aka. data fit in the memory of today's typical workstations/laptops (< 16 GB).  Therefore you will be given a URL from where compressed data files can be downloaded.  For structured data, these files when uncompressed will be typically CSV. For unstructured they will be in various formats depending on the use case. In most instances, ML frameworks that implement training will require certain transformations to optimize the format for the framework at hand (see TFrecords in tensorflow).  

Appendix B of Garon's book goes into more detail on the [steps suggested to be followed in an end to end ML project](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/app02.html#project_checklist_appendix).
