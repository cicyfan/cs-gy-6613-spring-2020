## Standard Python
Below is a list of recommended courses you can attend to. We will go over briefly [basic Python](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material/blob/master/tutorials/python/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb) in this lecture. The tutorials below are self contained and can remind you the basics. 

1. [CodeAcademy Data Science Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science). Take Python modules 4-10. This course contains Numpy and Panda intro as well. 

2. [Kaggle Python Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)

3. [Google Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) This is a bit dated as it covers Python 2, but it is still highly regarded as Python 3 and 2 have few differences.

## Numpy specific
We will go [Numpy Tutorial from Stanford's CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/).

## Pandas (optional)
Pandas may not be needed for the AI course. In any case, this is the effectively "official" documentation on Pandas:
