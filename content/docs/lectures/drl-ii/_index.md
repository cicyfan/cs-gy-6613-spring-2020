# Deep Reinforcement Learning II

In this chapter we will understand the following unified view of Reinforcement learning and embark on two important algorithms: SARSA and DQN completing this part of the course.

*Unified View of RL*

The algorithmic exploration in RL is a very long journey as shown below - we will cover only 2-3 algorithms that can be used as design patterns for the others.

Apart from the notes here that are largely based on [David Silver's (Deep Mind) course material](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/) and [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ), the curious mind will be find additional resources [in the suggested book for this part of the course](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Python-Hands-dp-0135172381/dp/0135172381/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=) written by Google researchers as well as on [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com/resources/).
