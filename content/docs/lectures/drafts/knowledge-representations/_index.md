Original syllabus for lecture 12:

Every intelligent agent needs to know how the world works for each task it encounters. These facts are stored in its Knowledge Base also known as Knowledge Graph. In addition as the agent affects the environment it must be able to create the right representations using its perception systems and update the knowledge base with dynamic content. Finally it needs to draw conclusions - aka infer new facts from existing ones - that will help the task at hand.  Readings: AIMA Chapter 12 and selected papers. We will also review what kind of questions you are expected to face in the final exam. **Final projects are due 5/10/2020 11:59pm.**
