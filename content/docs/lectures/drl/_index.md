# Deep Reinforcement Learning

In this chapter we build upon what we learned in the [MDP]({{<ref "../mdp">}}) chapter and develop agents that can act in an initially unknown environment and learn via their interactions with it, gradually improving their policy.

These agents are different from the [planning agents]({{<ref "../planning">}}) where the _model_ of the environment is known and with _no interaction_ with it the agent improves its policy, using this model as well as problem solving and logical reasoning skills.

Apart from the notes here that are largely based on [David Silver's (Deep Mind) course material](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/) and [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ), the curious mind will be find additional resources in the suggested book by Google researchers as well as on [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com/resources/).
