title: Project 2 - Continual Learning for Robotic Perception
---

One of the greatest goals of AI is building an artificial continual learning agent which can construct a sophisticated understanding of the external world from its own experience through the adaptive, goal-oriented and incremental development of ever more complex skills and knowledge. Continual learning is essential in robotics where high dimensional data streams need to be constantly processed and where na√Øve continual learning strategies have been shown to suffer from _catastrophic forgetting_. 

You will use [this](https://vlomonaco.github.io/core50/index.html) dataset and evaluate your methods for New Classes (NC) scenario. This is a very active area in AI right now - see [here](https://sites.google.com/view/clvision2020/challenge?authuser=0)
