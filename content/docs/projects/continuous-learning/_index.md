# Project 2 - Continual Learning for Robotic Perception

**This project is due March 29 at 11:59pm**

One of the greatest goals of AI is building an artificial continual learning agent which can construct a sophisticated understanding of the external world from its own experience through the adaptive, goal-oriented and incremental development of ever more complex skills and knowledge. Continual learning is essential in robotics where high dimensional data streams need to be constantly processed and where na√Øve continual learning strategies have been shown to suffer from _catastrophic forgetting_.
