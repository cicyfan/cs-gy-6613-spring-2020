# Project 2 - Continual Learning for Robotic Perception

**This project is due March 29 at 11:59pm**

One of the greatest goals of AI is building an artificial continual learning agent which can construct a sophisticated understanding of the external world from its own experience through the adaptive, goal-oriented and incremental development of ever more complex skills and knowledge. Continual learning is essential in robotics where high dimensional data streams need to be constantly processed and where na√Øve continual learning strategies have been shown to suffer from _catastrophic forgetting_.

|  You will use [this](https://vlomonaco.github.io/core50/index.html) dataset and evaluate your method for New Class (NC) scenario.   |  Use the dataset provided [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/GradientEpisodicMemory)  based on [this paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7225-gradient-episodic-memory-for-continual-learning.pdf) |
|   Object recognition (classification).  | Object recognition (classification). |

The CORe50 option is more difficult than the MNIST option. Grading will happen relative to teams that selected the same option. The CORe50 option may require an AWS/Azure/Google cloud or NYU GPU compute  resource to run. MNIST should be able to run in Colab/Kaggle with standard free accounts. If you have access to compute, you will learn more from selecting the CORe50 option as this is closest to a real life dataset than the rotated MNIST which is not even testing for new classes - rather it tests CL on rotated version of classes it has seen before.

This is a very active area in AI right now - see [here](https://sites.google.com/view/clvision2020/challenge?authuser=0)
