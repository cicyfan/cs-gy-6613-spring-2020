      <description>AI Evolution according to DARPA If engineering difficulty has a pinnacle today this must be in AI domains that combines ML, optimal control and planning. autonomous cars and humanoids from Boston Dynamics fit the bill.
Initially there were rules.
 In the 1980s knowledge-base systems that hard-coded knowledge about the world in formal languages.  IF this happens, THEN do that.   They failed to get significant traction as the number of rules that are needed to model the real world exploded.</description>

      <description>The four approaches towards AI The Turing Test Approach A 5-min behavioral intelligence test, where an interrogator chats with the player and at the end it guesses if the conversation is with a human or with a programmed machine. A Turing contest (Loebner Prize) is is held annually since 1991.
This course&amp;rsquo;s projects includes the Alexa prize which is not a turing test. The Alexa Prize creates social bots that engage in interesting, human-like conversations, not to make them indistinguishable from a human when compared side-by-side.</description>

      <description>A typical AI stack today As we have seen from the syllabus, this course approaches supervised and unsupervised learning methods from an applied perspective - this means teaching concepts but at the same time looking how these concepts are applied in the industry to solve real world problems. In this respect here we take an architecture driven AI, presenting the components of AI in a form of a software stack but also how the components are mechanized in what we call ML Pipelines to provide the ML utility to applications.</description>

      <description>A Positive Reinforcement Loop What are the disciplines that need to cross fertilize to get a system that possesses intelligence? Lets start with a diagram that show not only the disciplines but also a way of working for the many specialists involved.
The diagram above highlights three fundamental axes that can deliver a system-based approach to AI. The Z axis is the scientific axis where many disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, mathematics and others make progress on.</description>

      <description>Agent-Environment Interface  An agent is a computer system that is situated in some environment, and that is capable of autonomous action in this environment in order to meet its design objectives.

 Anything wrong with this boat? ^ Imagine you are in 1844 (Cumberland Basin, April 1844) Value of Commerce. Anything wrong with this boat?
 AI Development - Wave I  Wave I is known as Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI) It is still being used today.   AI Development - Wave II  Wave II is known as Connectionism It is what Deep Learning is today.</description>
